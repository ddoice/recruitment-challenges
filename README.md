The readme pointed that performace was really important, so i used bitwise operations and bitmasks, to improve even more the performance there is a parameter in the signature to switch between two methods to speed up even more the calculations.

A small script compares the performance between both implementations:

```
npm run benchmarks
```

# Challenge 2 

Loading files using streams to lower the memory usage, incomplete ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
